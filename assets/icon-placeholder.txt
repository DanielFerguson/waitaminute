Icon files need to be generated:

1. Open create-icons.html in your browser
2. Click the "Download" button under each icon
3. Save them to this assets/ folder with the correct names:
   - icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

The icons show a green circle with a pause symbol (||) to represent
"waiting a minute" before proceeding.

Once you've saved the icons, you can delete this placeholder file.
